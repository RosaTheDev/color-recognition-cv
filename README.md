# Color Recognition with Computer Vision

## Inspiration
I wanted to do this project out of inspiration from [@iotlab616](https://www.tiktok.com/@iotlab616) on TikTok. Her projects are amazing, and I recommend others check out her page!

## Motivation
Since this is my first time working with or even hearing about Computer Vision, I decided to embark on this journey with the help of ChatGPT-4. I'll be using it as a guide to bounce my thoughts back and forth, and I plan to make detailed notes on the steps we worked on together.

## Project Goals
- **Goal 1**: Detect and recognize specific colors (e.g., Red, Green, Blue) in real-time using a webcam feed.
- **Goal 2**: Draw bounding boxes around the detected color regions.
- **Goal 3**: Optimize the detection process to reduce false positives and improve accuracy.

## Project Setup
### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your local machine
- Installed the following Python libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `Pillow`
  
### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-recognition-cv.git
   cd color-recognition-cv
